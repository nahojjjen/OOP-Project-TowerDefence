 * Unknown date modified by Johan Swanberg
 *
 * 08/04 modified by Linda Evaldsson. Refactoring to Creep instead of AbstractCreep. speed-variable changed to int instead of double.
 * 16/04 modified by Simon GislÃ©n. Added support for creep devolution.
 * 23/04 Modified by Simon. Adding resources and XP when killing creeps
 * 24/04 modified by Johan, creeps now use their center when calculating movement instead of upper left corner
 * 12/05 modified by Linda Evaldsson. Removed Map. Added Path and ParticleManager instead.
 * 
 * An abstract class for creeps. Concrete creeps extends this class.
